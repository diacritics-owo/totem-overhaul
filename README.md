# Totem Overhaul

A mod that redesigns the totem system to be more immersive and lore-able

## Compatibility

- [Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) or
  an equivalent mod - jewels glow
- [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade)

## Incompatibilities

- Most (all?) shaders - the jewel texture layer for empty totems will be black,
  not transparent (only a minor cosmetic issue)
