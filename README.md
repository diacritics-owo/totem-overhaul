# Totem Overhaul

A mod that redesigns the totem system to be more immersive and lore-able

## About

Totem Overhaul completely redesigns the totem system to be more immersive and challenging. No longer do evokers drop a totem upon death - instead, you must obtain a jewel that can be inserted into an empty totem bought from a cleric villager.

## Compatibility

- [Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) or
  an equivalent mod - jewels glow
- [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade)

## Incompatibilities

- A few shaders, including Complementary Shaders - the jewel texture layer for
  empty totems will be black, not emissive (only a minor cosmetic issue)
